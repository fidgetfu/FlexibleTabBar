# FlexibleTabBarController

forked from MHTabBarController by Matthijs Hollemans

This is a custom container view controller for iOS 5 that works just like a regular UITabBarController, except the tabs are at the top and look different.

I am making some upgrades to this project:
- universal support
- some configuration possible in it's delegate
- choice of where to put the tab bar, what size to make it
- demonstrate with core data support
