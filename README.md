# FlexibleTabBar

forked from MHTabBarController by Matthijs Hollemans

This is a custom container view controller for iOS 6 and beyond that works just like a regular UITabBarController, except that there are a LOT more options. And! Best of all! You can put it anywhere!

Features:
- universal support, separate settings for iPad and iPhone
- configure appearance of tab bar via FTB-Settings.h
- choice of where to put the tab bar, what size to make it (top, bottom ,left, right)
- demo shows the tab bar in use with core data and uinavigationcontroller
