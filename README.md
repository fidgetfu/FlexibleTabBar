# FlexibleTabBar

forked from MHTabBarController by Matthijs Hollemans, now with 100% more autolayout

This is a custom container view controller for iOS 6 and beyond that works just like a regular UITabBarController, except that there are a LOT more options. And! Best of all! You can put it anywhere!

There are two versions of FTB in this project, one with rect drawing and one with autolayout. I reccommend you use the autolayout one - it's shinier and has more features. But if you must have pixel specific control, the rect drawn one is still available.

There's also a Sketch document with the app icon and a color planner inside so you can choose colors for the tab bar.

Features:
- universal support, separate settings for iPad and iPhone
- configure appearance of tab bar via FTB-Settings.h
- choice of where to put the tab bar, what size to make it (top, bottom ,left, right)
- helpful demo shows you how to use it!
- drawn using autolayout code which looks great in any orientation or screen size
